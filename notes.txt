funcemental React Concepts 
    Components: This is one of the best parts about react. 
        everything is broken up into separate reusable components. 

    javaScript: React can be used in tandem with vanilla JavaScript. 

    JSX: JSX is a syntax used in React Components that looks similar 
    to HTML. 

    Props: Props are a nice way of passing data around the app and 
         down through the Components. 
    
    State: You'll learn alot about how the state of an application 
        changes and how we can see the state change, without 
        having to rerender the entire DOM. 

    LifeCycle Methods: LifeCycle methods allow us to run components at certain times
        before page load, in the middle and at the end.
